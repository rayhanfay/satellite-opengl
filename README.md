# Satellite OpenGL Project

This project is a comprehensive OpenGL-based application developed as a final project to demonstrate various computer graphics transformations. It integrates multiple transformation techniques into a cohesive program, showcasing the capabilities of OpenGL in rendering complex animations.

## Features

* **Translation**: Moving objects to different positions in the coordinate space.
* **Rotation**: Rotating objects around a specified axis.
* **Curves**: Implementing and displaying curves such as Bezier and B-Spline.
* **Shear**: Applying shear transformations to distort the shape of objects.
* **Reflection**: Mirroring objects across a defined axis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* C/C++ compiler supporting OpenGL (e.g., GCC)
* OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) or FreeGLUT
* An IDE or text editor (DEV C++)

## Project Structure

* `Satelite Tower.c` – Main source code implementing the satellite tower with various transformations.
* `Makefile.win` – Makefile for compiling the project on Windows systems.
* `Satelite Tower.dev` – Project file for Dev-C++ IDE.
* `Satelite Tower.exe` – Compiled executable file.
* `Satelite Tower.layout` – Layout configuration file.
* `Satelite Tower.o` – Object file generated after compilation.
